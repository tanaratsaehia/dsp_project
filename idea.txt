    recognition activity like walk, run, using elevator etc.
    for track and analyze human action


To Do List
    1. Define all activity class (walk, run, using elevator, using stair)
    2. Develop Android APP for collect data
    3. Create Signal process algorithms
        - clean data (remove noise)
        - classifier
    4. combine algorithms with android app (deploy)
